            <h2>Their Parents and Family</h2>
            <p>Building meaningful relationships is fundamental to effective ministering towards children. From an analytical viewpoint, personal connections foster trust and openness, creating a supportive environment where a child feels valued and understood. A mentor figure engaging with a young person through simple, genuine interactions, such as playing a game or sharing a meal, underscores the profound impact of personal relationships.</p>
